    "**Ans 41**: Adversarial attacks are a type of attack that tries to fool a machine learning model into making a wrong prediction. In the context of neural networks, adversarial attacks are often done by adding small, carefully crafted perturbations to the input data. These perturbations are often imperceptible to humans, but they can cause the neural network to make a wrong prediction.\n",
